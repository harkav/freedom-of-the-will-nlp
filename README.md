# Using NLP to track the evolution of the conecpt of freedom of the will in Greek philospohy

## I'll use differnt techniques in NLP (Natural Language Processing) to track the different developments of the concept of a free will. 

## I'll draw on research from both leading philosophers working on the field, as well as techniques in NLP. 

## The purpose of this project is largely to teach myself the different NLP techniques that might be handy, as well as more about the philosophical 
## discussion on the topic. 

## The philosophical aspect of this project is mostly approached from a historical-philosophical perspective, i.e., I'm not trying to either make the case or argue against freedom of the will, but rather to track the development of the concept through the years. 

## I will however work from the hypothesis that there are several different stages of the conception of freedom of the will, and these stages seem plausible to me at the beginning of the project: 

- Pre-will theory of action. Perhaps non-exicisting, but will explore. 

- Will plays into action, but the actor has no agency. (Aristotle)

- Actor has agency over the will, but still not at the "could've done otherwise" stage. (Epictetus)

- Could've done otherwise.
